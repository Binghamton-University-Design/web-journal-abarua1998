						<h1>Project 1: Visual Message to Celestial Beings</h1>

						<img src=images/aliens.png title="Project 1" />

						<p>This plaque is an SOS signal to any alien(s) that happen to come across it. Earth is a gosh darn mess, with many terrible things happening at once. It is undeniable that we need help. I propose that we hire extraterrestrial help.</p>

						<p>I included the diagram seen in both the pioneer plaque and the voyager record because it's purpose is to pinpoint our location. I have also included a diagram of our solar system and an arrow to indicate exactly which planet in said solar system we are. I included Pluto in said diagram because even if Pluto isn't a planet it is still a round planet-like thing that orbits around our sun, and therefore it deserves to feel included. I added a picture of our planet so when someone finally finds our planet they can visually identify it.</p>

						<p> One of the bigger challemnges in this project was to adequately communicate that we need help without the use of words, as aliens probably do not speak English (or any human language for that matter). I decided to include icons in the shape of triangles because organisms (even if extraterrestrial) recognize that objects with sharp corners are either dangerous or in danger. I have also included "SOS" in morse code in hopes that aliens understand morse code. </p>
